This is a game where you try to drag the golf ball to hit it into the hole. 


Run [Main.java](src/main/Main.java) to start the game.

[Main](src/Main) is a package that includes the [GamePanel](src/main/GamePanel) that includes the basic game loop, 
[Main.java](src/main/Main.java) that makes a gamePanel and start the game, 
and [MouseHandler.java](src/main/MouseHandler.java) that make the mouseHandler methods.

[Objects](src/Objects) is a package that makes other objects in the game.
